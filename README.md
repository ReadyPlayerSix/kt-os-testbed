# Initialize system optimization
optimizer = SystemOptimizer(
    monitoring_level='detailed',
    adaptation_rate=0.85,
    pattern_recognition=True
)

# Configure resource monitoring
monitor = ResourceMonitor(
    metrics=['cpu', 'memory', 'io'],
    sampling_rate='1ms'
)

# Example optimization loop
async def optimize_system():
    while True:
        metrics = await monitor.get_metrics()
        optimization = optimizer.calculate_optimization(metrics)
        await optimizer.apply_optimization(optimization)
```
