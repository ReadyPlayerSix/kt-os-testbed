# K(t) Framework Implementation Strategy

## Core Principles
1. **Natural System Behavior**
   - Framework does not require stress testing to failure
   - Uses mathematical models to understand system limits
   - Works with natural performance curves

2. **Standardized Quick Scan**
   - Only 3-4 strategic data points needed
   - Baseline (idle), ~25%, ~50%, ~75% load points
   - No need to test upper limits
   - Extrapolates complete curve from minimal data

3. **Universal Curve Shape**
   - Efficiency/load relationship follows consistent pattern
   - Core mathematical model applies across all systems
   - Only scale factors change with different hardware
   - Based on fundamental resource utilization principles

## Implementation Approach

### Hardware Detection
- Use standardized system interfaces (Registry, WMI, /proc, /sys, IOKit)
- Read specifications through OS-provided APIs
- Future-proof through use of standard system locations
- Hardware-agnostic metrics collection

### Data Collection Strategy
1. **Quick Initial Scan**
   - Detect system capabilities
   - Apply normalized workloads
   - Collect strategic data points
   - Map to known curve shape

2. **Continuous Optimization**
   - Background monitoring during normal use
   - Pattern recognition for system behavior
   - Ongoing refinement of parameters
   - No artificial stress testing needed

### Key Advantages
1. **Efficiency**
   - Minimal testing required for initial setup
   - Quick time-to-value for users
   - Non-disruptive to system operations

2. **Future Proofing**
   - Hardware-agnostic approach
   - Uses standardized interfaces
   - Core mathematics remain valid
   - Adaptable to new hardware capabilities

3. **Safety**
   - Never pushes systems to limits
   - Works within natural performance boundaries
   - Non-destructive testing approach

## Next Steps
1. Implement standardized quick scan
2. Develop normalized workload calculations
3. Create hardware-agnostic metrics collection
4. Build continuous optimization system

## Technical Notes
- Framework uses sigmoid curve for efficiency modeling
- Cognitive load calculations adapt to system capabilities
- Scale factors derived from system specifications
- Continuous refinement through pattern recognition
